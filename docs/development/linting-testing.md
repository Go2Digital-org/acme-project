## Available Composer Scripts

### Quality Assurance
```bash
# Run all quality checks
composer quality

# Fix code quality issues
composer quality:fix

# Individual tools
composer pint:test      # Code style check (Laravel Pint)
composer stan          # Static analysis (PHPStan)
composer psalm         # Security analysis (Psalm)
composer rector:dry    # Refactoring suggestions (Rector)
composer deptrac       # Architecture boundaries (Deptrac)
```

### Testing
```bash
# All tests
composer test:all

# By test suite
composer test:unit
composer test:integration
composer test:feature

# Advanced testing
composer test:mutation    # Mutation testing with Infection
composer test:coverage    # Code coverage report
composer security         # Security-focused Psalm analysis
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Complete CI pipeline
composer ci              # Quality checks + all tests

# Pre-commit hooks
composer pre-commit       # Fix issues + run checks
```

## Tool Configurations

### Rector Configuration Highlights
- **PHP Version**: 8.2+ compatibility
- **Architecture-Aware**: Excludes domain models to prevent constraint violations
- **Laravel Integration**: Modern Laravel patterns and conventions
- **Code Quality**: Dead code removal, early returns, type declarations

### Infection Configuration Highlights
- **Mutation Coverage**: Tests quality of unit test suite
- **Performance**: Configured for parallel execution where possible
- **Targeted Testing**: Focuses on core business logic in modules
- **Reporting**: HTML, JSON, and text reports generated

### Psalm Configuration Highlights
- **Security First**: Strict taint analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Laravel Compatible**: Designed for framework-heavy codebases
- **Incremental**: Can be run on specific modules or files
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type checking for better code reliability

### Deptrac Integration
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Enforces clean architecture boundaries
- **Domain Isolation**: Prevents domain layer from depending on infrastructure
- **Module Boundaries**: Ensures proper separation between bounded contexts

## Quality Metrics

Each tool contributes to overall code quality:

- **Rector**: Automated code modernization and consistency
- **Infection**: Mutation Score Indicator (MSI) targets 75-80%
- **Psalm**: Security vulnerability detection and type safety
- **Deptrac**: Architectural constraint compliance
- **PHPStan**: Static analysis at level 8+ 
- **Laravel Pint**: PSR-12 code style compliance

## Usage Recommendations

### For Development
```bash
# Before committing
composer pre-commit

# Daily quality check
composer quality

# Weekly deep analysis
composer test:mutation
composer security
```

### For CI/CD
```bash
# Pipeline stages
composer quality       # Fast quality gate
composer ci           # Full validation
composer test:mutation # Weekly/nightly
```

### For Security Reviews
```bash
composer psalm:security  # Taint analysis
composer psalm:baseline  # Establish baseline
```

## Tool Synergy

The tools work together to provide comprehensive coverage:

1. **Rector** → Modernizes and standardizes code
2. **PHPStan** → Catches type and logic errors  
3. **Psalm** → Adds security analysis layer
4. **Deptrac** → Enforces architectural integrity
5. **Infection** → Validates test suite effectiveness
6. **Pint** → Ensures consistent formatting

## Integration Status

- **Rector**: Configured and working
- **Infection**: Configured and working (requires code coverage)
- **Psalm**: Configured and working  
- **Deptrac**: Already installed and working
- **Composer Scripts**: All scripts configured and tested
- **Architecture Support**: Optimized for hexagonal architecture
- **Laravel Integration**: Framework-aware configurations

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Code Coverage**: Install pcov or xdebug for mutation testing
2. **Baseline Creation**: Generate baselines for gradual improvement
3. **CI Integration**: Add quality gates to continuous integration
4. **Team Training**: Familiarize team with new tool commands
5. **Metrics Monitoring**: Track quality improvements over time

This setup provides enterprise-grade code quality assurance with tools totaling over 20,000+ GitHub stars, ensuring the ACME Corp platform maintains the highest standards of code quality, security, and architectural integrity.
