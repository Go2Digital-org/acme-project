# Redis Queue Infrastructure Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Redis queue infrastructure and background job system implemented for the ACME Corp CSR platform.

## Overview

The platform now uses Redis as the primary queue driver with multiple specialized queue channels, comprehensive error handling, progress tracking, and monitoring capabilities. All heavy operations have been moved to background processing to ensure optimal performance for 20,000+ concurrent users.

## Queue Infrastructure

### Redis Configuration

**File**: `/config/database.php`
- Added dedicated Redis `queue` connection on database 7
- Configured with persistent connections and optimized timeouts

**File**: `/config/queue.php`
- **Default Driver**: Redis
- **Multiple Queue Channels**: payments, notifications, exports, reports, maintenance, bulk
- **Priority System**: 1-10 priority levels with dedicated worker processes
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable attempts
- **Worker Configuration**: Auto-scaling based on queue load and time

### Queue Channels

1. **payments** (Priority 10)
   - Timeout: 180 seconds
   - Max tries: 5
   - Memory: 256MB
   - Exponential backoff: [30, 60, 120, 300, 600] seconds

2. **notifications** (Priority 8)
   - Timeout: 120 seconds
   - Max tries: 3
   - Memory: 128MB
   - Backoff: [15, 30, 60] seconds

3. **exports** (Priority 6)
   - Timeout: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
   - Max tries: 2
   - Memory: 1024MB
   - Backoff: [60, 180] seconds

4. **reports** (Priority 6)
   - Timeout: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
   - Max tries: 3
   - Memory: 512MB

5. **maintenance** (Priority 1)
   - Timeout: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
   - Max tries: 1
   - Memory: 256MB

6. **bulk** (Priority 2)
   - Timeout: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
   - Max tries: 1
   - Memory: 1024MB

## Performance Optimizations

### Queue-Specific Optimizations
1. **Memory Management**: Queue-specific memory limits prevent OOM errors
2. **Timeout Configuration**: Appropriate timeouts for different job types
3. **Priority Processing**: Critical jobs processed first
4. **Batch Processing**: Large exports processed in chunks
5. **Connection Management**: Persistent Redis connections

### Monitoring and Alerting
1. **Queue Wait Times**: Configurable thresholds with alerts
2. **Failed Job Monitoring**: Automatic notifications for critical failures
3. **Memory Usage Tracking**: Worker memory monitoring
4. **Progress Broadcasting**: Real-time updates via WebSockets

## Usage Examples

### Dispatching Jobs

```php
// Process payment webhook
ProcessPaymentWebhookJob::dispatch('stripe', $webhookData, $signature, $donationId);

// Send email notification
SendEmailJob::confirmation('user@example.com', 'Subject', $data);

// Export campaigns
ExportCampaignsJob::dispatch($filters, 'excel', $userId, $exportId);

// Cleanup expired data
CleanupExpiredDataJob::dispatch(['job_progress', 'export_files']);
```

### Monitoring Progress

```php
// Get job progress
$progress = JobProgress::find($jobId);
echo "Progress: {$progress->progress_percentage}%";
echo "Status: {$progress->status}";
echo "ETA: {$progress->estimated_completion_at}";
```

### Queue Management

```bash
# Start Horizon
php artisan horizon

# Monitor queues
php artisan horizon:status

# Clear failed jobs
php artisan queue:flush
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_QUEUE_DB=7

# Queue worker configuration
QUEUE_HIGH_WORKERS=3
QUEUE_MEDIUM_WORKERS=2
QUEUE_LOW_WORKERS=1

# Monitoring
QUEUE_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
QUEUE_ALERT_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
```

### Redis Requirements
- Redis 5.0+ recommended
- Minimum 2GB RAM allocation
- Persistent storage for reliability
- Network latency < 10ms

## Security Considerations

1. **Webhook Validation**: All webhooks validated before processing
2. **Job Serialization**: Secure job data serialization
3. **Permission Checks**: User-based job access control
4. **Data Privacy**: Configurable data inclusion in exports
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive job execution logging

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Queue Workers**: Deploy with process managers (Supervisor)
2. **Redis High Availability**: Master-slave configuration
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for queue failures
4. **Backup Strategy**: Include Redis data in backups
5. **Resource Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on queue depth

## Next Steps

### Pending Implementations
- GenerateReportJob for PDF/Excel report generation
- BackupDatabaseJob for automated database backups
- SendBulkNotificationJob for campaign updates
- SendWeeklyDigestJob for employee summaries
- SendReminderJob for campaign deadline notifications
- Job status dashboard for admin monitoring
- Queue management commands for worker supervision

### Future Enhancements
- Machine learning-based job prioritization
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Multi-tenant queue isolation
- Cross-region job distribution
- Enhanced security features

This implementation provides a robust, scalable background job system capable of handling the platform's current and future needs while maintaining excellent performance and reliability.
