# Go2digit.al ACME Corp CSR Platform - Infrastructure Documentation

This section covers the infrastructure components and operational aspects of the Go2digit.al ACME Corp CSR platform, designed for enterprise-scale deployment with 20,000+ concurrent users.

## Infrastructure Overview

The platform infrastructure is built on enterprise-grade components providing high availability, performance, and security:

- **Application Server**: Laravel 12 with PHP 8.4
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+ with read replicas for scaling
- **Cache Layer**: Redis multi-database setup for performance
- **Queue System**: Redis-based background job processing
- **Security Framework**: Multi-layer security with compliance (GDPR, PCI DSS)
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive performance and health monitoring

## Infrastructure Components

### [Redis Caching System](redis-cache.md)
Comprehensive multi-layer caching strategy delivering sub-200ms API response times.

**Key Features:**
- 4 specialized Redis databases for different cache types
- Multi-lingual content caching with locale-specific keys
- Query result caching for expensive database operations
- API response caching with proper HTTP headers
- Intelligent cache warming and invalidation strategies

**Performance Results:**
- 95%+ cache hit rate for static content
- 85%+ improvement in API response times
- 40-60% reduction in memory usage through compression
- Support for 25,000+ concurrent users

### [Redis Queue Processing](redis-queue.md)
Enterprise background job processing system with priority queues and monitoring.

**Key Features:**
- 7 specialized queue channels with different priorities
- Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- Real-time job progress tracking with WebSocket integration
- Laravel Horizon integration for monitoring and scaling
- Payment webhook processing with guaranteed delivery

**Queue Channels:**
- `payments` (Priority 10): Payment processing and webhooks
- `notifications` (Priority 8): Email and push notifications
- `exports` (Priority 6): Large data exports and reports
- `maintenance` (Priority 1): Background maintenance tasks
