# ADR-001: Hexagonal Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The ACME Corp CSR Platform is a complex enterprise application that needs to support multiple interfaces (web UI, API, CLI commands), integrate with various external systems (payment processors, email services, search engines), and maintain high testability and maintainability as the codebase scales.

Traditional layered architectures often lead to:
- Tight coupling between business logic and infrastructure concerns
- Difficulty in testing business logic in isolation
- Challenges when integrating new external services or changing existing ones
- Framework lock-in that makes it hard to evolve the application

We evaluated several architectural patterns:
1. **Traditional MVC/Layered Architecture**: Simple but leads to coupling issues
2. **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**: Clean separation of concerns
3. **Clean Architecture**: Similar benefits but more complex structure
4. **Onion Architecture**: Good isolation but steeper learning curve

## Decision

We will adopt **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as Ports and Adapters pattern) for the ACME Corp CSR Platform.

### Key Principles:
- **Domain at the Center**: Business logic is isolated in the domain layer
- **Ports**: Define contracts for external dependencies (repositories, services)
- **Adapters**: Implement ports using specific technologies (Eloquent, API clients)
- **Dependency Inversion**: Domain depends on abstractions, not implementations

### Structure:
```
Modules/
├── Campaign/
│   ├── Domain/
│   │   ├── Model/           # Domain entities
│   │   ├── Repository/      # Port interfaces
│   │   ├── Service/         # Domain services
│   │   └── Exception/       # Domain exceptions
│   ├── Application/
│   │   ├── Command/         # Use cases (CQRS commands)
│   │   ├── Query/           # Use cases (CQRS queries)
│   │   └── Handler/         # Command/Query handlers
│   └── Infrastructure/
│       ├── Repository/      # Adapter implementations
│       ├── Laravel/         # Framework-specific code
│       └── External/        # External service adapters
```

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Testability**: Domain logic can be tested in isolation without framework dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations (e.g., change from MySQL to MongoDB)
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns reduces complexity
- **Technology Independence**: Business logic is not tied to Laravel or any specific framework
- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different layers simultaneously
- **External Integration**: New integrations don't affect core business logic

### Negative:
- **Initial Complexity**: More files and interfaces to create initially
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand hexagonal principles
- **Boilerplate Code**: More interfaces and implementations compared to traditional MVC
- **Over-engineering Risk**: Simple CRUD operations might seem unnecessarily complex

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Comprehensive documentation and training on hexagonal patterns
- Code generators/artisan commands for creating module structure
- Clear examples in the codebase showing proper implementation
- Regular architecture reviews to prevent over-engineering

## Implementation Notes

1. **Modules**: Each bounded context (Campaign, User, Notification) is a separate module
2. **Ports**: Repository interfaces define data access contracts
3. **Adapters**: Laravel-specific implementations in Infrastructure layer
4. **Service Container**: Laravel's DI container binds ports to adapters
5. **Testing**: Unit tests use mock implementations, integration tests use real adapters
