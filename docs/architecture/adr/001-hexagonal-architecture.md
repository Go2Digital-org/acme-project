# ADR-001: Adopt Hexagonal Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The ACME Corp CSR platform requires an architecture that can:
- Support 20,000+ concurrent employees across global operations
- Enable multiple development teams to work independently
- Facilitate testing at different levels of abstraction
- Allow for technology changes without affecting business logic
- Maintain clear boundaries between business rules and technical implementation

Traditional MVC architecture in Laravel leads to:
- Business logic scattered across controllers, models, and services
- Tight coupling to the framework
- Difficult unit testing due to infrastructure dependencies
- Challenges in maintaining consistency across large teams

## Decision

We will implement Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) with three distinct layers:

### 1. Domain Layer (Core)
- Contains pure business logic and rules
- No framework dependencies
- Rich domain models with behavior
- Value objects for type safety
- Domain events for communication

### 2. Application Layer (Use Cases)
- Orchestrates domain operations
- Implements CQRS pattern
- Handles transaction boundaries
- Translates between domain and infrastructure

### 3. Infrastructure Layer (Adapters)
- Framework-specific implementations
- External service integrations
- Database persistence
- API controllers
- UI components

## Implementation Structure

```
modules/[ModuleName]/
├── Domain/                    # Core business logic
│   ├── Model/                # Domain entities
│   ├── ValueObject/          # Immutable values
│   ├── Repository/           # Interfaces only
│   ├── Specification/        # Business rules
│   └── Event/                # Domain events
├── Application/              # Use case orchestration
│   ├── Command/              # Write operations
│   ├── Query/                # Read operations
│   └── Service/              # Application services
└── Infrastructure/           # External adapters
    ├── Laravel/              # Framework implementations
    ├── ApiPlatform/          # API resources
    └── Filament/             # Admin UI
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Technology Independence**: Business logic is isolated from framework changes
2. **Testability**: Pure domain logic can be tested without infrastructure
3. **Team Scalability**: Clear boundaries enable parallel development
4. **Maintainability**: Organized structure reduces cognitive load
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new adapters (API, CLI, Queue)

### Negative

1. **Initial Complexity**: More files and directories than traditional MVC
2. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the architecture
3. **Boilerplate**: More code required for simple operations
4. **Indirection**: Multiple layers between request and response

### Mitigations

- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
- Create code generation tools (`php artisan hex:*` commands)
- Establish clear conventions and patterns
- Conduct architecture training sessions

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Traditional Laravel MVC
- **Pros**: Simple, familiar, less boilerplate
- **Cons**: Poor scalability, tight coupling, difficult testing
- **Rejected**: Does not meet enterprise scalability requirements

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- **Pros**: Ultimate scalability, technology diversity
- **Cons**: Operational complexity, network latency, data consistency challenges
- **Rejected**: Premature optimization for current scale

### 3. Modular Monolith (without Hexagonal)
- **Pros**: Module separation, simpler than microservices
- **Cons**: Still couples business logic to framework
- **Rejected**: Does not provide sufficient abstraction

## Metrics for Success

1. **Unit test execution time** < 5 seconds for domain layer
2. **Code coverage** > 90% for domain and application layers
3. **Module coupling** measured by Deptrac remains within boundaries
4. **Team velocity** increases after initial learning period
5. **Bug density** decreases in business logic
