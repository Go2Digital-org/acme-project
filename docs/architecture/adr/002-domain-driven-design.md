# ADR-002: Domain-Driven Design Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The CSR platform manages complex business domains including:
- Campaign lifecycle management with approval workflows
- Multi-currency donation processing with various payment gateways
- Employee participation tracking across departments and regions
- Regulatory compliance for multiple jurisdictions
- Real-time reporting and analytics

These domains have intricate business rules that:
- Change frequently based on business requirements
- Vary by region and regulatory environment
- Require deep domain expertise to understand
- Must be consistently applied across all interfaces

## Decision

We will implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with both strategic and tactical patterns:

### Strategic DDD

1. **Bounded Contexts**: Each module represents a bounded context
   - Campaign Context
   - Donation Context
   - User Context
   - Reporting Context

2. **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology across code and business
   - Domain models use business terms
   - Method names reflect business operations
   - Documentation uses domain language

3. **Context Mapping**: Explicit relationships between contexts
   - Shared Kernel for common value objects
   - Anti-Corruption Layer for external systems
   - Published Language for API contracts

### Tactical DDD

1. **Entities**: Objects with identity
   ```php
   class Campaign {
       private CampaignId $id;
       private CampaignStatus $status;

       public function approve(): void {
           // Business logic for approval
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Value Objects**: Immutable values
   ```php
   final class Money {
       private function __construct(
           private readonly float $amount,
           private readonly Currency $currency
       ) {}
   }
   ```

3. **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries
   - Campaign aggregate includes Goals and Milestones
   - User aggregate includes Roles and Permissions
   - Transaction boundaries match aggregate boundaries

4. **Domain Events**: Communication between aggregates
   ```php
   class CampaignApprovedEvent {
       public function __construct(
           public readonly CampaignId $campaignId,
           public readonly UserId $approvedBy,
           public readonly DateTime $approvedAt
       ) {}
   }
   ```

5. **Specifications**: Encapsulated business rules
   ```php
   class ActiveCampaignSpecification {
       public function isSatisfiedBy(Campaign $campaign): bool {
           return $campaign->isActive()
               && !$campaign->isExpired()
               && $campaign->hasRequiredApprovals();
       }
   }
   ```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Business Alignment**: Code structure mirrors business structure
2. **Knowledge Preservation**: Business rules are explicit in code
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Each context handles its own complexity
4. **Evolution**: Domains can evolve independently
5. **Communication**: Shared language between developers and domain experts

### Negative

1. **Initial Investment**: Requires domain analysis and modeling
2. **Abstraction Overhead**: More concepts to understand
3. **Performance Considerations**: Object creation overhead
4. **Learning Curve**: Team needs DDD knowledge

### Mitigations

- Conduct Event Storming sessions with domain experts
- Create domain model documentation
- Use factories to manage object creation
- Provide DDD training and resources

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Anemic Domain Model
- **Pros**: Simple DTOs, logic in services
- **Cons**: Procedural code, scattered business logic
- **Rejected**: Leads to unmaintainable code at scale

### 2. Active Record Pattern
- **Pros**: Simple, built into Laravel
- **Cons**: Couples persistence to domain logic
- **Rejected**: Violates separation of concerns

### 3. Transaction Script
- **Pros**: Straightforward for simple operations
- **Cons**: Duplication, no reuse, hard to test
- **Rejected**: Does not scale with complexity

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start with the Core Domain**: Focus on Campaign management first
2. **Iterate on the Model**: Refine through usage and feedback
3. **Maintain Boundaries**: Use Deptrac to enforce context boundaries
4. **Document the Language**: Maintain a glossary of domain terms

## Success Metrics

1. **Business Rule Bugs**: Reduction in logic-related defects
2. **Feature Velocity**: Faster implementation of domain changes
3. **Code Comprehension**: Time to understand business logic
4. **Duplication**: Reduction in repeated business logic
