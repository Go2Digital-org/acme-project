# Architecture Decision Records

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the ACME Corp CSR Platform. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the development and evolution of the platform.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. Each ADR describes a single decision and its rationale.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this standard format:

### Title
ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

### Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

### Context
The issue that motivated this decision and its context.

### Decision
The change that we're proposing and/or doing.

### Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult because of this change.

### Alternatives Considered
Other options that were evaluated but not chosen.

## Creating New ADRs

To create a new ADR:

1. Use the next available number in sequence
2. Follow the standard format template
3. Place in this directory with naming: `XXX-decision-name.md`
4. Update this index with the new ADR
5. Link from relevant documentation

## Review Process

All ADRs undergo technical review:

1. Initial proposal by technical lead or architect
2. Team review and discussion
3. Stakeholder approval for significant changes
4. Documentation and implementation
