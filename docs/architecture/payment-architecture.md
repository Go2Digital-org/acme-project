# Payment Gateway Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive payment gateway implementation for ACME Corp's CSR donation platform, featuring Mollie as the primary gateway and Stripe as the secondary gateway, with an extensible architecture for future gateway additions.

## Architecture

### Hexagonal Architecture Compliance
- **Domain Layer**: Payment gateway interface (port) defines the contract
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Concrete gateway implementations (adapters)
- **Application Layer**: Payment processing orchestration services
- **No Framework Dependencies**: Domain logic is completely isolated from Laravel

### Key Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Easy switching between payment gateways
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic gateway creation and selection
- **Value Objects**: Immutable payment data structures
- **Domain Events**: Decoupled payment processing notifications

## Extensibility

### Adding New Payment Gateways

To add a new payment gateway (e.g., PayPal, Square, Adyen):

1. **Implement Gateway Interface**:
```php
class NewPaymentGateway implements PaymentGatewayInterface
{
    // Implement all required methods
}
```

2. **Update Factory Configuration**:
```php
private const GATEWAY_CLASSES = [
    'mollie' => MolliePaymentGateway::class,
    'stripe' => StripePaymentGateway::class,
    'new_gateway' => NewPaymentGateway::class,
    'mock' => MockPaymentGateway::class,
];
```

3. **Add Configuration**:
```php
'gateways' => [
    'new_gateway' => [
        'api_key' => env('NEW_GATEWAY_API_KEY'),
        'webhook_url' => env('APP_URL') . '/webhooks/new-gateway',
        // ... other config
    ],
],
```

4. **Create Webhook Handler**:
```php
final readonly class NewGatewayWebhookController
{
    public function __invoke(Request $request): Response
    {
        // Handle webhook notifications
    }
}
```

### Configuration-Driven Gateway Selection
The system supports configuration-based gateway routing rules:

```php
// Future enhancement: Route based on business rules
'routing_rules' => [
    'european_donations' => ['gateway' => 'mollie', 'currencies' => ['EUR', 'GBP']],
    'us_donations' => ['gateway' => 'stripe', 'currencies' => ['USD', 'CAD']],
    'large_donations' => ['gateway' => 'stripe', 'min_amount' => 1000],
    'corporate_matching' => ['gateway' => 'mollie', 'special_handling' => true],
],
```
