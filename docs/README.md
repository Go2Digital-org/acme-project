## FAQ

### Why Hexagonal Architecture?

**Q: Why did we choose hexagonal architecture for this platform?**

A: Hexagonal architecture provides several critical benefits for enterprise applications:

- **Testability**: Business logic is isolated from external dependencies, making unit testing straightforward
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap infrastructure components (databases, APIs, frameworks) without affecting business logic
- **Scalability**: Clear separation of concerns allows teams to work independently on different layers
- **Maintainability**: Domain logic remains pure and framework-independent, reducing technical debt
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Supports complex business rules and compliance requirements effectively

### Why CQRS Pattern?

**Q: What benefits does CQRS bring to our CSR platform?**

A: Command Query Responsibility Segregation offers:

- **Performance**: Optimized read and write operations for different use cases
- **Analytics**: Separate read models enable powerful reporting without affecting transactional performance
- **Security**: Fine-grained access control between commands and queries
- **Scalability**: Read and write sides can be scaled independently based on usage patterns

### Module Organization

**Q: How do we decide what belongs in each module?**

A: Our modules follow Domain-Driven Design principles:

- **Campaign Module**: All campaign lifecycle management
- **Donation Module**: Payment processing and donation handling
- **User Module**: Authentication, authorization, and user management
- **Organization Module**: Multi-tenant organization features
- **Notification Module**: Communication and alert systems

Each module has clear boundaries and communicates through well-defined interfaces.
